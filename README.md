#  Inverse RIAA filter

Inverse RIAA filter for testing phono preamps. If we want to test phono preamps with
a soundcard interface, we need a lot of attenuation of the soundcard output - and we
would also like to invert the RIAA filtering that is part of an ordinary phono 
preamp such that the soundcard input receives a signal which, under ideal operation,
has a constant amplitude as the frequency varies.

This is a passive filter. I want to build it into a Hammond 1455N1201BK extruded box,
with isolated (stereo) BNCs in and out. There is an option to add 20 dB of attenuation
for testing MC phono preamps.
